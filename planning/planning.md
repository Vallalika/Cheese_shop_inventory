MVP FUNCTIONALITIES
    
1. Have been listed in the brief. Cross-compare with results of user needs analysis.

2. MVP
    - The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.

    - The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.

    - The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately.

    - Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.

    - As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.
    
EXTENSIONS
1. Cross-compare user needs analysis and figure out which extension to make

2. Possible extensions:
    - Calculate the markup on items in the store, and display it in the inventory
    - Filter the inventory list by manufacturer.
    For example, provide an option to view all books in stock by a certain author.
    - Categorise your items. Books might be categorised by genre (crime, horror, romance...) and cars might be categorised by type (SUV, coup√©, hatchback...). Provide an option to filter the inventory list by these categories.
    - Mark manufacturers as active/deactivated. Deactivated manufacturers will not appear when creating new products.

3. Other extensions:
    - Based on user needs analysis

4. Redo planning
